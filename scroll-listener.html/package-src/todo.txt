* Border offsets for ltr language browsers
* Do right and bottom border offsets need to be applied under circumstances other than rtl languages?
* Proxy Table Rectangles as Min Size
  ----------------------------------
Consider proxying table rectangle coordinates as minimum sized rectangle for containers above table
(may implement a proxy wrapper that can be passed up to parent scopes, and indeed wrap other proxies). This is necessary because tables
tend to overflow DIVs and other containers such as BODY and HTML. If this is done, then the BODY and HTML elements could be re-included
in the ScrollEventTargetCollection.auto() method - but do they actually fire a scroll event? 
NOTE: Such behaviour MUST NOT break parent containers that are themselves scrollable.
NOTE that this behaviour should be optional (perhaps configurable using CSS).
NOTE: Applying style.width = "fit-content" to containing divs fixes the table overflow problem as does style.overflow = "auto", 
however the problem will persist if scope is not limited to containers with these style settings as they themselves will overflow
parent containers (at least, they appear to do so with BODY and HTML).
